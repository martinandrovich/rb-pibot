# rb-pibot

The objective og this project is to build a robot that can follow a wall autonomously as reliably and quickly as possible. The robot should accept start and stop commands via an ad-hoc wireless network. It should also support requests for sensor and control parameters.

This project is developed in Bash and Python, built using the CamJam EduKit 3 on a Raspberry Pi Zero, interfaced using `ssh` from a Linux console.

The Pi is assigned the IP `192.168.99.<group number>` and should be able to join the ad-hoc network `pibot`. It has a TCP server running at port `:8080`, which accepts various [commands](doc/COMMANDS.md).

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your Raspberry Pi with the camJam EduKit 3 for development and testing purposes.

The controller is running on [Rasbian Stretch Lite (2019-04-08)][1] with Python 3.5 (installed per default). The robot is assembled as instructed by the [EduKit guide][2], with the ultrasound sensor being mounted on and pointing towards the left side.

The only external dependency is the `rpi.GPIO` package for Python 3, which can be installed via the command:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-rpi.gpio
```

Once downloaded, the python module can be run from the root directory of the project using:

```bash
python3 -m pibot
```

Commands can be issued to the Pi using `socat` via the terminal, with the IP address and port by defualt set to `localhost:8080` (can be configured in `app.py`). The robot can be started by using the command:

```bash
printf start | socat - tcp:localhost:8080
```

In order to communicate with the robot wirelessly, SSH must be enabled on the Raspberry Pi. It is then possible to configure the Pi to connect to an ad-hoc network or simply communicate with it using SSH over the WiFi. The IP address of the Pi's server must be configured accordingly.

## Extras

### IP gist posting script

The file `scripts/gist-ip-post.py` can be used to automatically post the IP address of Raspberry PI to a specified Github Gist, specifying the IP address used to SSH into the Pi when it is connected to `eduroam`.

### Ad-hoc network

In order to connect to the ad-hoc network, the file `/etc/network/interfaces` must be modified to the following:

```bash
auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
    address 192.168.99.5
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    wireless-channel 1
    wireless-essid pibot
    wireless-mode ad-hoc
```

This removes the internet capabilities of the Pi and accessing the SSH must now be done via the ad-hoc network.
